Here lies notes that I take throughout my learning journer

 - 'w' and 'b' essentially are the same as <Ctrl><Left> and <Ctrl><Right> respectively
     - remember you can use (n)<Ctrl>(direction) to move 'n' words to the left or right
 - pressing <C-d> in Command mode will show list of options (similar to <tab> in terminal)
 - press <C-w-w> to switch between windows openned in the same neovim window
     - <:q> to close focused window
 - < / > (while in Normal mode) to search within a file



Changes to commit in settings/'init.lua':

-- key(binds/maps)
 □ C-back -> del prev w
 □ C-S-back -> del prev w (inc punct)
 □ C-S-(up/down) -> start/end of file | emulate (gg/G)
 ☑ C-(up/down) -> emulate C-(u/d)
 □ S-(up/down) -> prev/next non-empty line
 □ 
 □ 
 □ 

-- other
 □ change a keybind that already exists...
 □ Ctrl-Backspace -> deletes prev word
     - <C-shift-backspace> -> deletes prev word inc. punct.
 □ switch to Normal mode whenever the window loses focus
 □ `:w` on window-focus loss
 ☑ change <Ctrl><Up> and <Ctrl><Down> to work just like <Ctrl>U and <Ctrl>D
     - if last word of line: go to end of line (?)
 □ mayyyybe set a timeout:  ` if 5(?) seconds pass with no input: switch to Normal mode `
